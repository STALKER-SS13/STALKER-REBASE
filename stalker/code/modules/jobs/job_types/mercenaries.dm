They are perhaps ex-military soldiers, ex-special forces operators, or possibly underground fighters such as elite resistance/guerrilla troops, a private military company or notorious terrorists of various nations who offer their services to the highest bidder. Because mercenaries have no established code of ethics to abide to, each mercenary group's sense of morality could be quite different from another."
